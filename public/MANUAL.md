# Unnamed Tierlist Maker 2

## Webpage

Go to https://acertainprogrammer.github.io/UnnamedTierlistMaker2/ and start working!

## Local installation

```
git clone https://github.com/aCertainProgrammer/UnnamedTierlistMaker2.git
cd UnnamedTierlistMaker2
npm ci
npm run dev
```

## Putting champions in the tierlist

1. Drag and drop champions into tiers
2. Start typing to search a champion, then press 1-9 to put the first champion in the list into the corresponding tier

## Filtering roles

1. Press on the role buttons to select filters
2. Use the keybinds: `Shift` + `1` (resulting in `!`) by default to toggle the toplane filter, then `2/3/4/5` for the rest of the roles

## Customisation

### Stop delete from clearing the tierlist

If enabled, stops delete from clearing the tierlist - made for people who press delete without intention, it helps avoid frustrating situations

### Clear search bars on focus

If enabled, clears the search bars on reentry. It allows you to do somethings like this:

1. Type `camille`
2. Press `1` to pick Camille into the first tier
3. Type `irelia`

without having to clear the search bar at any point

### Use legacy search

- `Legacy search` is pure substring matching - if a word contains the exact string of the search query, it will be matched - for example, "ji" will match "JInx".
- `Modern search` uses both substring matching and checks for letter order ("ji" matches "seJuanI") to deliver an experience more similar to league client search

### Append to snapshots on import

If enabled, appends to snapshots when you import them instead of replacing them entirely  

### Looks

These settings change how the program looks, just play around with them for a bit

### Binds

You can customize your binds here, just remember that you need to use `Shift` to trigger them, so something like `Shift` + `1` would actually be `!` in the bind menu (at least for my keyboard)

## The top bar buttons

### Settings cog

Opens the settings menu

### Question mark

Opens the manual

### Image icon

Takes a screenshot of the tierlist

### Reset tierlist

Resets the tierlist to the default state with tiers S to F and no champions in them

### Import/export tierlist

Allows you to save a tierlist as a file and import it later, useful for sharing tierlists with others for quick edits

### Use draft pool template

Sets five tiers for roles top to support, this is a purely a visual thing - the draft pool exports in the next sections work on tiers 1 to 5, without checking their names

### Import draft pool

Allows you to either import a draft pool from file (you export the file with the Export draft pool button), or from https://acertainprogrammer.github.io/UnnamedDraftingTool/ , from the custom data in that program


### Export draft pool

Allows you to either export a draft pool as a file, or to directly put it into https://acertainprogrammer.github.io/UnnamedDraftingTool/ 

Remember to turn on custom data in UnnamedDraftingTool or you won't see the changes!

### Save snapshot

Saves a snapshot of the tierlist for later viewing and usage

### Show snapshots

Opens the snapshot selection, you can name them, screenshot them and delete. 

The export and import works the same as the tierlist one. Click on a snapshot to load it.

Start typing to search, you can search by the snapshot name or by the champions in it

## Other keybinds

- `Shift` + `V` to save a snapshot
- `Shift` + `G` to open the snapshot menu
- `Shift` + `L` to take a screenshot
- `Shift` + `A` to take a screenshot + export tierlist + open draft pool export modal
